# Poke Detector
it's a very front-end oriented project to try the drag and drop functionality similar
to trello, you have a board to mount some pokemon cards and a very nice CSS design, also a sorting algorithm made in JavaScript to place and reorder the cards.
plus+ you have nice and smooth animations.
the anime images are from the artist Sevi Yummy which I preselected from free resources on the internet.
